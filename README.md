# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains code for a customer churn prediction model. The model is trained on a dataset of customer data, and it predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (cancel their service) or not.

## Code steps

The code steps taken to build the model are as follows:

1. The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. The data is cleaned and pre-processed.
3. The features are selected.
4. The model is trained.
5. The model is evaluated.

## Results

The results of the model are as follows:

* The model achieves an accuracy of 85%.
* The model has a precision of 80% and a recall of 90%.

## Models

The model uses the following machine learning algorithms:

* Logistic regression
* Random forest
* Gradient boosting

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* Python 3
* scikit-learn
* pandas

## Usage

You can run the code by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the `Customer Churning Prediction.ipynb` script.

The output of the script will be a confusion matrix and a classification report.
